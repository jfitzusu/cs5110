Answers to Questions:
1. What did I like about the implementation?
I'm not sure if this is refering to my own implementation or the starter implementation. Either way, I like how most objects are just represented as a set of points. There's no need to store an entire game grid, although it might have benefits in some situations. I also liked how easy pygame is to work with, it has a very simple method of drawing to the screen, and the game look is pretty easy to implement. I also liked making the worms shoot, it was pretty fun.

2. What suggestions do you have for improvement?
None really, it's a pretty neat assignment.
